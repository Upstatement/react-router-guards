> Guard middleware for React Router navigation

React Router Guards provides a middleware API for [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), allowing you to perform complex logic between the call for navigation and the final render of a route.

## Requirements

This package has the following [peer dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies):

- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) v16.8.0+ (for hooks ⚓️)

- [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) v5.0.0+

## Installation

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```shell
$ npm install react-router-guards
```

With [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```shell
$ yarn add react-router-guards
```

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import { GuardProvider, GuardedRoute } from 'react-router-guards';

// using CommonJS modules
const GuardProvider = require('react-router-guards').GuardProvider;
const GuardedRoute = require('react-router-guards').GuardedRoute;
```

## Basic usage

Here is a very basic example of how to use React Router Guards.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { GuardProvider, GuardedRoute } from 'react-router-guards';
import { About, Home, Loading, Login, NotFound } from 'pages';
import { getIsLoggedIn } from 'utils';

const requireLogin = (to, from, next) => {
  if (to.meta.auth) {
    if (getIsLoggedIn()) {
      next();
    }
    next.redirect('/login');
  } else {
    next();
  }
};

const App = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <GuardProvider guards={[requireLogin]} loading={Loading} error={NotFound}>
      <Switch>
        <GuardedRoute path="/login" exact component={Login} />
        <GuardedRoute path="/" exact component={Home} meta={{ auth: true }} />
        <GuardedRoute path="/about" exact component={About} meta={{ auth: true }} />
        <GuardedRoute path="*" component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </GuardProvider>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

## Concepts

### [Navigation lifecycle](/docs/navigation-lifecycle.md)

> With the addition of guard middleware, the navigation lifecycle has changed.

### [Guard functions](/docs/guard-functions.md)

> Guard functions are the middleware between navigation and rendering.

### [Page components](/docs/page-components.md)

> Page components are used for setting loading and error pages.

### [Guard Provider](/docs/guard-provider.md)

> The `GuardProvider` component is a high-level wrapper for your entire routing solution.

### [Guarded Route](/docs/guarded-route.md)

> The `GuardedRoute` component acts as a replacement for the default [`Route`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/api/Route) component provided by React Router, allowing for routes to use guard middleware.

## Demos

We've included some demos below to help provide more context on how to use this package!

### Basic

[Demo + Source](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-guards-basic-demo-forked-83dkh)

The basic demo showcases some basic functionality of route guard API with an auth example.

### Intermediate

[Demo](https://react-router-guards-demo.netlify.com) | [Source](demos/intermediate)

The intermediate demo uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to showcase how to use route guards for fetching data from an API.
